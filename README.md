WORP is an Inhouse Project under Dr. K. Arthi Ma'am, SRM Institute of Science and Technology.

In this project, we have created a College Management Application under which all the functions of Discord, Google Meet, Google Classroom, and WhatsApp are here.

==> Designing an educational tool for the use of faculty and students where it prohibits the use of personal chats and emojis.

==> Just the use of personal chats, channels, and video conferencing for the transformation of useful information in the hierarchical order.

==> The Project Name is WORP which uses the WhatsApp, Discord, and Google Meet model to share data within the organization.

==> It's a user-friendly Web Based Website for the smooth conveying of information within an organization.

**This project is still under development**
